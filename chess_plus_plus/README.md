# Running the application
1. From this directory, run docker-compose build. This will rebuild the images.
2. From this directory, run docker-compose up. Will run the images that were just built.

# To run without Docker
Simply start the server and the frontend as usual.

Currently, the frontend is available at port 3000 and the backend is at port 5001.
